          dbase        Either a string containing the name of the .csv or fixed-width-format
                       file containing the database, or a Pandas DataFrame of the database.

                         "Abbrev"     The abbreviated name of the solid

    Class for 'Solutions': Typically a liquid, or more general a

    The name 'Liquid' was chosen instead of 'Solution' because (1) the
    word 'solution' has too many other meanings, and can be confusing,
    and (2) for the geophysical and astrophysical community the most
    common uses would be for melts. But this class can equally well be
    used for solid solutions. The only condition is that a Gibbs energy
    can be defined on the entire domain of the system (all x positions).

    please use the SolidSolution class instead.

        Arguments:

          name         The name of this liquid or alloy. Can be as simple as e.g.,
                       'liquid' (for a melt) or 'solid' (for an alloy or glas).
                       Only important if one has more than one continuous
                       non-stoichiometric phases.

          components   List of names of the system components out of which this liquid
                       or alloy is composed. Important to assure the appropriate
                       order of the x-values when this class is used in other
                       parts of the code. For example, if components =
                       ['MgO','SiO2','CaO'] and the fractional abundances are
                       given as [0.2,0.7,0.1], then it means that the liquid has
                       0.2 mole fraction of MgO, 0.7 mole fraction of SiO2 and
                       0.1 mole fraction of CaO. Particularly important if other
                       parts of the code use only a subset of these components,
                       or a different order of them.

          Gfunc        A Python function for Gibbs(x) where x is either a 1D array
                       [x[0],x[1]...x[M-1]] with M = len(components) or x is a
                       2D array x[N,M] with N is the number of sampling points
                       in the M-dimensional phase space. The function Gfunc must
                       be able to accept these 2D x arrays (i.e., 1D array of
                       arrays x[0:M]), for efficiency, so that a single call to
                       Gfunc returns a 1D array or G values at all x-points.

        Optional:

          kwforGfunc   A dictionary of possible keyword arguments for the Gfunc,
                       in case your function needs additional information to be
                       passed on.

          resetfunc    A function with arguments (T,P), i.e. temperature (in Kelvin) and
                       pressure (in bar) that reconfigures the Gfunc to compute
                       the Gibbs energy for the new T and P.

          gammafunc    If set, this is a function gamma(x), the activity
                       coefficient, defined such that the activity a=gamma*x.

        IMPORTANT NOTE: In PhaseHull all liquids are mapped onto the same grid.
                        For each grid point, PhaseHull will then check which of
                        the liquids has the lowest Gibbs energy, and will take
                        that liquid for that point. This is different from the
                        SolidSolution class, where each instance has its own

          crystals     A list of instances of the CrystalDataBase class. Usually just one.

          liquids      A list of instances of the Liquid class. Typically 1 (liquid) or 2 (liquid,solid).
                       Notice that liquid simply means: non-stoichiometric solution. It does not have
                       to be truly liquid. For instance, alloys are also continuous mixed phases, so they
                       would also be a 'liquid' in this sense.

          solsols      Some solid solutions may only exist in a lower-dimensional subspace of the full
                       system. Example: Ca(1-x)Mg(x)SiO4 in the CaO-MgO-SiO2 system. This cannot be
                       modelled using a Liquid class. For this the SolidSolution class is designed.
                       However, please note that this class is less powerful (e.g. it does not
                       participate in the automatic grid refinement). So if you can use the Liquid
                       class for your solid solution, then that is advisable.

          nres0        If liquids are present, nres0 determines the base grid resolution: it is the
                       number of grid spacings between 0 and 1.

          nrefine      If liquids are present, nrefine determines the nr of cycles of grid refinement.

          nfact        If liquids are present, nfact gives the refinement factor per refinement step.

          nspan        If liquids are present, nspan gives the width of the refinement zone around the
                       binodal curves.

          min_nr_tielines   Is a criterion for grouping of tie simplices.

          T            Temperature in Kelvin

          P            Pressure in bar

        There are a set of options for the kind of information to be stored for each simplex:
        
          incl_ptnames     Include the names of all the points of the simplex
          incl_xvals       Include the x-coordinates of all the points of the simplex
          incl_Gvals       Include the G values of all the points of the simplex
          incl_xcen        Include the x center of the simplex
          incl_Gcen        Include the G center of the simplex
          incl_xtie        For those simplices that are tie lines, include the tie line x values

        Other options:

          xgrid        If you want to have full control of the base grid of the liquids (before
                       refinement) you can set xgrid. It should be an array with indices [ipt,icomp]
                       where ipt is the index of the point, and icomp goes from 0 to M-1, which is
                       the index of the component. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure that nres0 is properly
                       set to 1/dx, where dx is the smallest grid spacing in the xgrid. This is
                       important for the grid refinement (if you set/keep nrefine>0).

        Calling PhaseHull will automatically start the computation of the phase diagram for the
        given temperature T and pressure P for which the crystals and liquid(s) are given. If a liquid
        or other non-stoichiometric material is included, then also a grid refinement is performed.
        This will create a set of every refined calculations. The corresponding results are all
        in the lists self.the<something> where <something> is e.g. pts, ids, simplices, hulls etc.
        The final (highest resulution) one is always the last one, which can be easiest obtained
        with the [-1] index, as in pts = self.thepoints[-1], and simplices = self.thesimplices[-1].

        Result:

          PhaseHull's product is a set of N simplices (= line elements in a binary system, triangles
          in a ternary system, tetrads in a quaternary system etc) that fill the entire phase space
          in the x-coordinates (= the region between 0 and 1 in a binary system, the triangle between
          [1,0,0], [0,1,0] and [0,0,1] for a ternary system etc). The number of simplices N can be
          any number >= 1, and tends to be larger, the more complex the phase diagram is. The
          information about this set of simplices is located in PhaseHull.thesimplices[-1]. So you
          have

            phull       = PhaseHull(....)
            simplices   = phull.thesimplices[-1]

          This is a dictionary containing a set of arrays/lists of length N (one value for each simplex).
          These arrays or lists are:

            simplices['x']          np.array((N,ncomp,ncomp)) where ncomp is the number of components, 
                                    such that simplices['x'].sum(axis=-1)==1. The last index is 
                                    therefore the index of the coordinates. The middle index counts
                                    the corners of the simplex, and the first index is, as said above,
                                    the index counting the simplices.
            simplices['stype']      The list of physical types of the simplices. E.g. if
                                    simplices['stype'][5]=='cryst_1_liq_1', then simplex 5 is of the
                                    type of a coexistence of one crystals with one liquid.
            simplices['id']         Just in case the order of the N simplices gets mixed up, this is
                                    the original integer index of the simplices.
            simplices['id_qhull']   The index of the simplex as it was in the Qhull results. Note that
                                    not all Qhull simplices are included here, because Qhull also
                                    returned the simplices at the top (rather than the bottom) of the
                                    convex hull.
            simplices['ipts']       np.array((N,ncomp)) of the indices of the points at the corners. 
                                    The coordinates of the points can be found in PhaseHull.thepoints[-1].
            simplices['G']          np.array((N,ncomp)) of the G values at the corners. Only if
                                    incl_Gvals is set.
            simplices['neighbors']  np.array((N,ncomp)) of the indices of the neighboring simplices.
                                    A neighbor shares a face with another simplex.

          Sometimes there may be fewer or more contents than these. With simplices.keys() you can
          get a list of all the contents of this dictionary.

        In cases with a large number of simplices (e.g., when you have one or more liquids), it might
        become a bit difficult to get an overview. Here are some methods to get a better overview:

          PhaseHull.select_simplices_of_a_given_kind(stype):
                   Returns the indices (for the above simplices arrays) of all simplices of the
                   kind stype, where stype is a string such as e.g., 'allcryst' or 'cryst-1-liq-1'.

          PhaseHull.get_tie_lines_simplices():
                   Returns the indices of all simplices that are tie lines.

          PhaseHull.get_tie_line_groups():
                   Returns a list of groups of tie lines (for ternary or larger systems). This is
                   useful because in ternary or larger systems, tie lines are usually in bundles.

          ...more to come...

        If you want to redo the computation for a different temperature or pressure, you can call:

          PhaseHull.reset(T,P)

        which then also automatically starts the computation, unless you set nocompute=True as keyword.

        IMPORTANT NOTE:

          So far (16 Sep 2025) only up to ternary phase diagrams have been thorougly
          tested. Not sure if all simplex types are complete for higher order
          systems. This may need some additional work.

        The product of PhaseHull is a set of simplices (in a binary model = line elements,

        bottom of the convex hull. PhaseHull will try to classify the physical meaning of
        each of these simplices. For instance, a tiny simplex is likely part of a continuous
        liquid; if the analytic G(x) lies below that simplex, then this simplex is clearly
        a discrete part of the liquid. A very elongated simplex, in particular when the
        analytic G(x) lies above it, is very likely a tie line. Currently implemented
        type (called 'stype') are:

           liquid            Fully liquid
           allcryst          A coexistence of 2 (for binary) or 3 (for 
                             ternary) (etc) crystals.
           cryst_1_liq_1     A coexistence of 1 crystal phase with
                             1 liquid phase (only for binary diagrams).
           cryst_2_liq_1     A coexistence of 2 crystal phases with
                             1 liquid phase (only for ternary diagrams).
           cryst_1_liq_2     A coexistence of 1 crystal phase with
                             2 liquid phases (only for ternary diagrams),
                             but not a tie line.

                             meaning of a tie line between 1 crystal and
                             1 liquid point (only for ternary diagrams).
                             This is a very elongated simplex. Its
                             meaning is that of a binary phase line 
                             in a ternary diagram. The two fluid points
                             are actually a single fluid, but it becomes 
                             two very-nearby fluid points due to the
                             discretization.
           tieline_c0l3      A coexistence of two liquid phases that
                             are inmiscible  (only for ternary diagrams).
                             In reality 3 liquids are connected, two
                             being very close together.
           inmisc_liquids_3phase   Like 'inmisc_liquids' but for
                                   three phases. In a ternary diagram
                                   these occasionally show up as big
                                   single triangles.

        For now only physical meanings for up to ternary diagrams are
        included, but this is easily extendable to quaternary diagrams
        and higher. Types:
    
           liquid            Fully liquid
           allcryst          A coexistence of 2 (for binary) or 3 (for

           cryst_1_liq_1     A coexistence of 1 crystal phase with
                             1 liquid phase (only for binary diagrams).
           cryst_2_liq_1     A coexistence of 2 crystal phases with
                             1 liquid phase (only for ternary diagrams).
           cryst_1_liq_2     A coexistence of 1 crystal phase with

                             but not a tie line.
           tieline_c1l2      Like cryst_1_liq_2, but with the physical
                             meaning of a tie line between 1 crystal and
                             1 liquid point (only for ternary diagrams).
                             This is a very elongated simplex. Its
                             meaning is that of a binary phase line

                             are actually a single fluid, but it becomes 
                             two very-nearby fluid points due to the
                             discretization.
           tieline_c0l3      A coexistence of two liquid phases that
                             are inmiscible  (only for ternary diagrams).

                             being very close together.
           inmisc_liquids_3phase   Like 'inmisc_liquids' but for
                                   three phases. In a ternary diagram
                                   these occasionally show up as big
                                   single triangles.

                    last value. So x = pts[:,:-1] while mfDfG = pts[:,-1].
    
          idlist    List of the same length as pt with the identity of
                    each point. For instance, if you have 3 solid
                    crystals (say 'SiO2','MgO', and 'MgSiO3'), and
                    200 liquid points, then the idlist would look like
                    this: ['SiO2','MgO', 'MgSiO3', -1, -1, ... , -1]
                    where -1 has the meaning of the liquid.

              the crossing with the simplex inside of which x is. since the
              simplices are the bottom of the hull, these highest points
              are, in fact, the lowest value, at x, of the volume enclosed
              by the convex hull. It works. But a much more efficient
              method would search for the right simplex by walking through
              the simplices using the hull.neighbors array. For arrays of
              contiguous x points, one can use the previous simplex as an
              initial guess for finding the current simplex. This is, however,
